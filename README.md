## üöÄ What is T-RexGPT?

T-RexGPT is a toy hack, with obstacle-dodging capabilites for the classic Chrome dinosaur game.  
I created this because, nothing beats showing off your high score to your friend :).

## üß† Features

- ü§ñ Auto-jumps when a cactus dares to exist - üåµ
- ‚ö° Super responsive (like a caffeinated squirrel, yeah: that's true!) 
- üî• Paste-n-play ‚Äì no extension, no stress  
- üíª 100% JavaScript. 0% ethics. üòÑ


## üéÆ How to Use

1. Open the Chrome Dino Game (chrome://dino)
2. Open DevTools (Ctrl+Shift+I) or Right-Click -> Inspect.
3. Paste the magic from t-rex-gpt.js
4. Watch your Jumpasaurus like he got wings and a Super Mushroom power-up!


## üí¨ Why?

Because we could.  
Because we‚Äôre lazy.  
Because the dinosaurs didn‚Äôt survive, but your high score will, forever ;)


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

T-RexGPT takes no responsibility if your productivity vanishes,  
or if you develop a god complex watching your dino do your job better than you.
